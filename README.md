# GoToClassBot
This project is a bot that goes to my online school classes.<br />
I used Selenium to automate my browser but in order to use this program you'll need to install [chrome web driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and replace PATH variable with the path of your driver.<br>
also I used the new feature of python 3.10 with is **match case** and works like the switch in java
